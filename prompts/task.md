Title: Designing a Stress-Aware Neuro-HCI Experiment on Cognitive Load

Objective:
Design a within-subject HCI study that manipulates cognitive load/stress via interface/task factors
(e.g., time pressure, multitasking, error cost) and measures outcomes across behavioral, subjective,
and proxy physiological channels.

Deliverables (≤ 2 pages per draft):
1) Tasks & Manipulations: at least 2 difficulty/pressure conditions; clear independent/dependent variables.
2) Measures:
   - Behavioral: accuracy, response time, error rate.
   - Subjective: NASA-TLX short form, SUS (or 5-item usability proxy).
   - Proxy physiological: pupil/keystroke/scroll dynamics (if no sensor, specify simulation/secondary logging).
3) Participants & Procedure: target N (justify minimally), counterbalancing, manipulation checks.
4) Analysis Plan: stats test choice + effect size; multiple comparison control (brief).
5) Ethics: consent highlights, burden minimization, stop rules, debriefing.
6) Open Science: seeds, filenames, directory tree, README items.

Constraints:
- Keep the protocol minimal but executable in a replication setting.
- Avoid any real-world identifiable data; all examples must be anonymized/simulated.
- Write in double-blind style (no institution names).

Audience: ICAIS reviewers (AI × HCI × CogNeuro).
