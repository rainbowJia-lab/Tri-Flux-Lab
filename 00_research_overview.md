# Tri-Flux Lab: Stress-Aware Neuro-HCI Virtual Research Framework

## 1. Background & Motivation
Scientific discovery is not only computational but also cognitive and emotional.  
Researchers’ psychological states—stress, focus, and perceived safety—shape creativity and reproducibility.  
Tri-Flux Lab integrates **AI**, **Cognitive Neuroscience**, and **HCI** to model these dimensions  
in an automated, reproducible research environment.

## 2. Research Objective
To simulate how **social-emotional conditions** (supportive vs. pressure)  
and **disciplinary configurations** (cross-disciplinary vs. single discipline)  
affect the **quality and reproducibility** of AI-generated research outputs.

## 3. System Architecture
- **AI Scientist Agent:** Generates hypotheses, tasks, and analysis plans.  
- **Cognitive Neuroscience Agent:** Ensures construct validity and interprets cognitive-load manipulations.  
- **HCI Agent:** Designs usable protocols, participant tasks, and UX measures.  
- **IRB/Ethics Agent:** Manages consent, risk, and debriefing templates.  
- **Open-Science Agent:** Packages data/code for public replication.

## 4. Experimental Protocols
| Experiment | Manipulation | Description | Expected Outcome |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **E1** | Cross-disciplinary vs single-discipline | Compare five-agent pipeline vs AI-only | Cross-disciplinary lab yields higher protocol completeness and validity |
| **E2** | Supportive vs Pressure | Simulate emotional climate | Supportive setting increases reflection quality and reproducibility |

## 5. Metrics
- **Protocol Completeness (PC):** 6 key elements present (0–6)  
- **Construct Validity (CV):** 1–5 expert rating  
- **Usability Burden (UB):** 1–5 HCI agent score  
- **Ethics Readiness (ER):** 1–5 compliance checklist coverage  
- **Reproducibility (OSR):** Replication success rate (%)  
- **Consistency (J):** Jaccard overlap of key terms across agents

## 6. Expected Deliverables
- Open-source replication package (`tri-flux-artifacts-anon.zip`)  
- ICAIS 2025 paper (≤10 pages, LaTeX template)  
- Integration with DeepScientist API for automated refinement

## 7. Impact
Tri-Flux Lab demonstrates a path toward **emotionally intelligent AI science**,  
bridging computational reasoning and human cognition to enable transparent, ethical, and reproducible research.
