# Tri-Flux Lab: Cross-Disciplinary Virtual Research System

### Overview
Tri-Flux Lab is an interdisciplinary **virtual research laboratory** that integrates  
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Cognitive Neuroscience**, and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**  
to explore how *stress, cognitive load, and social-emotional climates* influence the  
quality and reproducibility of scientific discovery.

The project is submitted to **ICAIS 2025 (International Conference on AI Scientist)**  
under the Human-Led Track.  
It also serves as a baseline research workflow for integration with **DeepScientist**,  
an AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery.



### Motivation
Most AI-for-Science systems focus on automation but neglect cognitive and emotional factors  
that shape scientific collaboration. Tri-Flux Lab asks a fundamental question:

> **Can an AI research system model the psychological and social conditions of science itself?**


### Research Design
- **E1: Cross-Disciplinary vs. Single-Discipline Pipelines**  
  Compare full Tri-Flux Lab (AI + CogNeuro + HCI + IRB + OpenScience)  
  with a single-agent AI-only workflow.

- **E2: Supportive vs. Pressure Climate Simulation**  
  Run identical lab pipelines under two social-emotional settings  
  (supportive feedback vs. high-pressure criticism).

- **Metrics:**  
  Protocol Completeness, Construct Validity, Usability Burden,  
  Ethics Readiness, Reproducibility, Cross-Disciplinary Consistency.
