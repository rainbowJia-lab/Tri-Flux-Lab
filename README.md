# Tri-Flux Lab: Cross-Disciplinary Virtual Research System

This repository is a minimal open-science artifact for the **Tri-Flux Lab**, an interdisciplinary virtual lab integrating **AI**, **Cognitive Neuroscience**, and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**.

The goal is to simulate scientific collaboration under different social-emotional conditions (supportive vs. pressure) and evaluate how cognitive and social factors influence scientific reproducibility and experiment design quality.



## Repository Structure

prompts/ # Role definitions, affect templates, and task cards
eval/ # Metrics, scoring templates, and evaluation scripts
figs/ # Figures for ICAIS 2025 submission
runs/ # Logs and AI-generated drafts
reproduce.sh # One-click reproduction script (placeholder)


## Planned Experiments
- **E1:** Cross-disciplinary vs. single-discipline lab design
- **E2:** Supportive vs. pressure social climate manipulation

Each experiment outputs structured reports and reproducibility metrics (protocol completeness, construct validity, usability burden, ethics readiness, reproducibility).


## Baseline Code
The current version includes placeholder files and documentation for the Tri-Flux Lab experimental design workflow.  
Executable prototypes will be uploaded upon acceptance to the **DeepScientist Platform**.
